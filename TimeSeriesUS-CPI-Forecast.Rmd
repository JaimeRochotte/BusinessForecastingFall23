### This dataset provides monthly data of US Consumer Price Index (CPI). Average of CPI for all US cities in a given month is provided. 

#### Details of columns:
+ Yearmon - Year-month in date format. Day is provided as 1 for each month.
+ CPI - Consumer price index. This is an index that measures the monthly change in prices paid by U.S. consumers.

#### The data set is intriguing as it displays the change in prices over the years for U.S. consumers.

```{r}
# Random Plot
set.seed(30)
y <- ts(rnorm(50))
plot(y)
Acf(y)

#Convert date column to date
US_CPI$Yearmon <- as.Date(US_CPI$Yearmon)
#Conver to TS, using Date formatting for Start period, and freq of 12 to do periods monthly
US_series.ts <- ts(US_CPI$CPI, start= c(as.numeric(format(US_CPI$Yearmon[1],"%Y")), as.numeric(format(US_CPI$Yearmon[1], "%m"))), frequency = 12)

# Residuals
US_CPI2 <- HoltWinters(US_series.ts)
attributes(US_CPI2)
plot(US_CPI2)
#Forecast
US_CPIF <- forecast(US_CPI2)
plot(US_CPIF)
plot(US_CPIF$residuals)
hist(US_CPIF$residuals)
Acf(US_CPIF$residuals)
accuracy(US_CPIF)
```
#### The accuracy measure to utilize is ME as the value is smallest.
